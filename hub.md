### **What It Is**
A simply great integration to generate and verify web tokens within your bot. JSON Web Token (JWT) is a URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It is commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes in web applications. 

### **How It Works**
JWTs consist of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The header specifies the algorithm used to sign the token, the payload contains the information about the user, and the signature is used to verify the integrity of the token.
